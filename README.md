# Survival Analysis + Machine Learning on Breast Cancer Data

## Description

This project focuses on a detailed survival analysis and a complete machine learning workflow applied to fixed-time prognostic prediction. Statistical techniques such as descriptive analysis, overall and stratified survival curves and Cox regression were performed. Feature extraction, feature reduction, differential expression analysis and models such as Lasso, Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Networks and Random Forest were applied in the machine learning workflow. The data set downloaded from The Cancer Genomics Athlas (https://www.cbioportal.org/) represents a cohort of patients diagnosed with breast cancer. Clinical variables and normalized RNAseq data were considered.
